            <p class="about">My name is Diego Pena and I am currently enrolled in the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp at the same time I am also in college studying to become a computer science major. I have grown up around and with a computer almost my whole life giving me a jumpstart amongst most people who just now are beginning to get their hands on this same technology. I enjoy the aspects of problem solving and having to think outside of the box constantly as a developer and love the rewarding feeling of meeting the results I wanted. I am currently looking to get my foot in the door and get some development experience through an employer while finishing out college.</p>
